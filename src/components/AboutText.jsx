    <h1 className="text-center text-5xl mb-4">About Me</h1>
    <p className="text-center mb-4">I'm Nate, a Full-Stack Software Engineer driven by transforming ideas into dynamic digital experiences. My journey began in athletics. Driven to be the best basketball player I could be, I always pushed myself beyond my limits to become a professional athlete. Although I had a promising future, a health condition caused me to pivot from that dream. That pivot led me toward another lifelong passion: technology. As a kid, I developed an early fascination, leading to roles in tech consulting and cellular sales, where I gained deep insights into user behavior and software functionality. Armed with a psychology degree and hands-on tech experience, I bring a unique perspective to software development, combining technical expertise with human-centered design principles. With the rise of artificial intelligence, I focus on its optimistic potential to make the world a better place, and I see a promising future for myself in the tech industry. Whether I'm coding, practicing martial arts, hiking, or diving into a good book, I consistently pursue growth, creativity, and inspiration through new experiences.</p>
